// @ts-expect-error untyped dependency

// This declaration exists because redux-thunks is not typed, and has a dependency on
// Canvas State.  Therefore, creating a wrapper that strongly-types the function-- and creates
// a single point of replacement, should the need arise-- is a nice workaround.
